Hello world message

Hi! 
A noob here and a tech lover. I challenged myself to learn something after my studies. The first is to improve my knowledge of German language, and the second is to learn Java. So wish me luck folks. Ahh, you can tell I'm new here since I'm calling you folks. Oh, well I will eventualy get with the terminology. 
All the best!
